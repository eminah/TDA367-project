1. Objectives (5 min). Resolve any issues preventing the team to continue.

The following things need to be resolved before next thursday:
* We need to start writing on the SDD.
* The RAD should be continued on.
* Divide the use-cases between the participants and start coding them.




2. Reports (15 min) from previous meeting


* From the previos meeting we have encountered problems with git and the commands. However, we are starting to get familiar with these now and therefore it all should work just fine now.


3. Discussion items (35 min) 


* We need to start writing on the SDD. Possibly divide it so that each individual can write on a specific task. Also, the RAD should be continued on.

* The use-cases have been divided between each participant, so that we can start implementing this project for real.

* Tecnical issues have also been resolved. The biggest one was that the project could not be run on some computers. The problem was found, and in order to fix this, the entire project had to be taken away and then cloned again on this computer. After this, it all worked just fine. Some have also had som issues with the git commands on their computers.
