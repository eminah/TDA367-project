Meeting Agenda

 Date: 30/3-15

 Facilitator: Heléne Jarl

 Participants: Emina Hromic, Heléne Jarl och Rasti Tengman (Ina Tran - sick) 

1. Objectives (5 min). Resolve any issues preventing the team to 
 continue.

We have not encountered any great issues so far, but the following things need to be resolved in order for us to get started with the project:


1. What needs to be done this week.
2. Split the work between each participant. 

2. Reports (15 min) from previous meeting

- Emina have looked at Maven and  Rasti have looked a little at the java FX packet.

3. Discussion items (35 min) 

We talked about how we do not feel so sure about git commands and how maven works. We need to look in to this because we do not want to run in to unnecessary problems that could have been avoided just by learning a little about the tools before we use the tools.


In the previous meeting our mentor told us that Java FX is a good packet to use for the application we want to create. So this is also something we would like to look a little bit more in to. Then we feel that it would be good to start our project by programming some basics. So know it’s time to conclude what “some basics” is and who should do what:



4. Outcomes and assignments (5 min) 

 - Read more about how java fx works and possibly try to create an easy application just to get the feeling of it.


   * Look more at Maven and how it is contstructed
   * Read about Java FX
   * Learn Git-commands
   * Decide which classes we need (UML).
   * Start programming some of the classes.
   * Start writing on the RAD
   * All of the above points has to be done by each member as soon as possible.


5. Wrap up
