We are aware of that all the members of the group may not have reached the goal for number of code. This since the work has been divided differently. Some have written more code, while others have written more on the RAD and SDD. An important addition is that Rasti has been the "cliff in the storm" and has practically carried the group over the finish line. We hope that you have indulgence with this as you review our project. 

Thanks in advance and enjoy the game!
